# Structural Design Patterns


## Author: Telug Anatolie, FAF-212

## Objectives:

* Get familiar with the Structural Design Patterns;
* Choose a specific domain;
* Develop the project for the specific domain using Structural Design Patterns;

## Theory:
`Structural design patterns` are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. The structural design patterns simplify the structure by identifying the relationships. These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.

`Bridge` pattern that decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

`Facade` pattern provides a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client. In other words, Facade pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

`Proxy` pattern provides the control for accessing the original object. So, we can perform many operations like hiding the information of original object, on demand loading etc.


## Used Structural Design Patterns: 

* Bridge
* Facade
* Proxy
